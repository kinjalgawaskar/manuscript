        The author Jessica Helfand, starts the passage by expressing to her readers about how a newly engaged form of any critical practice is necessary if it does not include exploring one’s originality. She speaks about how autonomy in graphic design is vital to sustain a designer’s true identity.

In the genesis of this article, Konstantin Stanislavski, a theatre practitioner, compares modern theatre by introducing a new system of training in which the actor would draw on his or her own emotions to truly understand their original character. He states “We protested against the old manner of acting and against theatricality, against artificial pathos and declamation,” in order to bring about a revolution in the field of acting. In contrast to the loud, overdramatic fashion, a character once understood could be portrayed much more subtly encompassing all his/her traits. This pedagogical system developed by Konstantin was titled ‘method training’ which was laster used to train designers.

        The writer states that although there could be fine system designed to teach design to students, but it may not prove to be a breeding ground for innovation. She mentions that she herself was an actress before she pursued graphic design, and struggled with implementing the ‘method design’ model into her work. Delving more into the emotional psychology aspect, Jessica expatiates about the necessity of ‘emotional honesty’ in design. Emotional honesty helps your audience resonate with your work or performance because spectators are always looking for a one-on-one connection with art. This method used in graphic design backfires paradoxically because the author states that students fail to establish their own identity in the mere process of trying to create work that befits set design standards. The line “The persistent evidence of impenetrable personal work in design schools across America is a serious epidemic, resulting in a kind of method designing that erroneously treats sentiment as substance, and why?” stands out as it reflects how art cannot be weighed and calculated rather it should be felt and fathomed with all five human senses. This reading served as a stimulus to keep asking difficult questions, solving harder problems, inventing better worlds, being true to ourselves as creators and not imposters.

          Schools of thought are always hotbeds of ideological controversy: there are always exceptions to the rule, deviations from the principal learning curve. In creative education this a particularly thorny issue: how to teach discipline and promote invention? Arguably, designers who were trained to understand twodimensional composition by crafting eight-by-eight inch plaka boards were more conscious of the former than the latter, while today’s design students firmly occupy the opposite camp. And while each approach might be said to be imperfect, it is the contemporary condition within which today’s design students are expected to “make work” that gives me cause for concern. To this day, method acting remains a highly regarded pedagogical model for training actors. But when did it become an appropriate system for educating designers.
