         <h1> Method Designing</h1>
         <h2> The paradox of Modern design education</h2>

            Over a century ago, Konstantin Stanislavsky revolutionized the modern theater by introducing a new system of training, in which the actor would draw on his or her own emotions to achieve a true understanding of a character. “We protested against the old manner of acting and against theatricality, against artificial pathos and declamation,” Stanislavksy wrote, and, indeed, in an era framed by considerable social and civil unrest, the very notion that characters could be shown to have an interior life was itself remarkably revolutionary. Through the practice of what we have come to know, today, as “method” acting, an actor could explore, identify, and ultimately reveal the degree to which a character could be a hugely complex human being with feelings, emotions, and often conflicting desires.</body>

     <p3> Schools of thought are always hotbeds of ideological controversy: there are always exceptions to the rule, deviations from the principal learning curve. In creative education this a particularly thorny issue: how to teach discipline and promote invention? Arguably, designers who were trained to understand twodimensional composition by crafting eight-by-eight inch plaka boards were more conscious of the former than the latter, while today’s design students firmly occupy the opposite camp. And while each approach might be said to be imperfect, it is the contemporary condition within which today’s design students are expected to “make work” that gives me cause for concern. To this day, method acting remains a highly regarded pedagogical model for training actors. But when did it become an appropriate system for educating designers.</p3>
